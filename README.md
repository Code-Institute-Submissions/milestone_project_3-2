# Activity manager

My project was designed for that is into been active, where they can log or delete there work outs.

The opening page gives you a list of all the activities that you have done.

## UX

This app is for people that are interested in logging there work outs. This app allows the customer to see what they have doneand what they can do.
It also gives the customer a visual experience with pictures work outs that were done.
In the footer of every page there are links to each page.

* As a new customer I want to find out more about the app.
* As a new customer I want to know what it can do for me.
* As a new customer can I check what I have done and going to do.
* As a new customer I want to see work that has done.

## Tech Used

* Balsamiq
  * This was used to do the mockups for the web page.

* Heroku
  * This what the app was to run on.

* Mongodb
  * Was the software data base that was used to store the information  

* Gitpod
  * This was the software that I used to write the html, css, javascript and Readme files.
  * It was used to store all the images and files.
   
* HTML 
  * This was used to create the mark up language.
   
* CSS
  * milestone_project_3/css/styles.css
    * CSS was used to style the elements of the HTML code.

* Javascript and JQuery

* Bootstrap
  * href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  * https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/js/bootstrap.min.js
  * https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js
  * https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.16.0/dist/umd/popper.min.js
    * These were all used to help style the website, the grid system layout of it, link the api of Google maps and the submit button for the contact page
  * https://startbootstrap.com/snippets/thumbnail-gallery
    * This page was used to get ideas for the layout

* Font Awesome
  * https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.1/css/all.css
  * https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,200,300,400,500|Exo:100,200,300,400
  * https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Aguafina+Script&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    * These were used to create a universal font for the website.

* Hover
  * https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js
    * This was used to have the hover styles run smoothly

* Validators
  * An [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) was used to check the code.
  * A [CSS checker](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) was used to check the stylings.

The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

I started writing the code in gitpod and saving it in the github repositorie, every time I would do somthing new I would run it and right click on the page and inspect it.

### base.html

* Go to home page
  * Make sure the list of tasks are there
  * Edit the tasks to make sure that is works
  * Click done to see if the tasks closes

### tasks.html

* Tasks
  * Add a new task by filling out the information
  * Make sure the task saves

###  categories.html

* Categories
  * Try to delete a category
  * Try to edit a category
   * Go to mongodb to see if it updates 

### Navigation and Footer

* Navigation
  * Try out each menu item on each page respectively
  * Make sure they lead to the correct place and can easily find your way back to starting point
  * Get another person to test this out for you
* Footer
  * Make sure each link works

## Mobile Responsive

* Each page was checked by using the Inspect tool on the browser and then choosing the different screen sizes to mack sure that the page reduce accordingly
* The HTML code was put through a validator every so often to make sure that it worked ok


## Deployment

In gitpod I deployed my project by pushing it in terminal window ( in bash ) to my Github repository named milestone_project_2 via the command line.  Each time an edit was done
I would save it to my [GitHub](https://github.com/Stubo087/milestone_project_3)
My GitHub page was built from the Master Branch.
